"""Given an NxM matrix, if a cell is zero, set entire row and column to zeroes.

A matrix without zeroes doesn't change:

    >>> zero_matrix([[1, 2 ,3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

But if there's a zero, zero both that row and column:

    >>> zero_matrix([[1, 0, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
    [[0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 6], [7, 0, 9]]

Make sure it works with non-square matrices:

    >>> zero_matrix([[1, 0, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]])
    [[0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 7, 8], [9, 0, 11, 12]]
